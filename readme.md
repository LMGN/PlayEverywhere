### FaQ

#### Does this use the 2 download/song limit?

No.

#### Does this send my Google login credentials to any server other than Googles?

No.

#### Does this store my Google login credentials?

No. We only use the login credentials once, store a unique token, and then discard login credentials.

#### Other than a Google account with songs in my library or a subscription, what do I need?

You'll need a playlist, as at the current point in time, you can only download playlists. You'll also have had an Android or iOS device login with the official app and stream a song at least once.
